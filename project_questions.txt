Here are some questions that we may want to ask:

Let's pick a year with the most current data 


What is the median household income for that year? (Split it up by race and compare)(Bar)

What is the change in household income between start_year and present_year(as close as we can get)?(Bar)

What is the Median income per capita? (Split up by race) (Bar)

What is the Change in Median income per capita between start_year and present_year(as close as we can get)? (Bar)

With these comparison I think that a bar chart would be best(I could be wrong)

Any suggestions for a pie chart questions would be greatly appreciated

Or we could find Median income by family size? (Bar)

What is the Distribution of median family income with children by family type (single female, single male, and married couple/same sex)?

What is the Distribution of median family income without children  by family type (single female, single male, and married couple/same sex)?
